# weather-app
I made this simple console weather app in java. I exported it as a .jar file and then converted it to a .exe so it can run on any PC.
The user can enter a location and my program sends that location to a free to use weatherstack API and returns the current weather data for your location.
This was a helpful project for learning API calls and extracting JSON data from an API call.
