# weather-app
I made this simple console weather app to learn more about pulling data from an API. Java is not the ideal language for this type of program but I thought it would be simple enough that id give it a try.
The user can enter a location and my program sends that location to a free-to-use weatherstack API and returns the current weather data.

This was a helpful project for learning API calls and extracting JSON data from an API call.
To run the .jar file cd to the location of the .jar file and enter java -jar filename.jar
